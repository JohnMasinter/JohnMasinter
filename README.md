- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnMasinter in Denver, Colorado, USA.
- 👀 I'm a software engineer (software architect, cloud architect, solution architect).
- 👀 I study the philosophy of software engineering, and I'm writing a book about how big companies get it terribly wrong.
- 👀 My focus is C/C++, Python, Linux, Kernel, OpenSSL, FIPS, STIG, Serverless Containerization, K8S / Kubernetes and discipline.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, MATLAB Simulink, Fusion 360, and Patience.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on FIPS 140-3, to develop open source tools to help others achieve certification. (as i have:)
- 💞️ I would like to sponsor and lead development of a FIPS patch, build and standalone cert of LibreSSL.
- 💞️ As SMACK is to SELinux, I would like to develop a lightweight and *sensible* alternative to K8S. (book proposal incoming)
- 💞️ I would like to develop an open source Simulink model to produce a fixed frequency patch antenna for SatCom. Input desired freq, output .gbr file.
- 📫 How to reach me john@masinter.net
