- 👋 Hi, I’m @JohnMasinter in Denver, Colorado, USA.
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux, Kernel, OpenSSL, FIPS, STIG, Cloud, Serverless Containerization, Kubernetes,  and Discipline. I could, and may, write a book on a couple of these subjects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning golang, Rancher, Rust, MATLAB Simulink and Patience.
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on FIPS 140-3, to develop open source tools to help others achieve certification. (as i have:)
- 💞️ I would like to sponsor and lead development of a FIPS patch, build and standalone cert of LibreSSL.
- 💞️ As SMACK is to SELinux, I would like to develop a lightweight and *sensible* alternative to K8S. (book proposal incoming)
- 💞️ I would like to develop an open source Simulink model to produce a fixed frequency patch antenna for SatCom. Input desired freq, output .gbr file.
- 📫 How to reach me john@masinter.net
